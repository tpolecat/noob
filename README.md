A set of 20-minute talks and exercises for **noob hour** at PDXScala. The goal is to have a set of fill-in exercises with predefined tests, so we can talk through the subject and everyone can fill in code as we go.

So far there is:

* **IN PROGRESS** `fold/` - an introduction to folding over lists.
* **IN PROGRESS** `evidence/` - using type constraints.
